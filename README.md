# Goose Chase Game

A simple goose chase game built with Processing. Control the goose and avoid being caught by the red dot(s)! The closer you stay to the centre of the screen, the more dots will spawn, increasing the challenge.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the goose around the screen.
- Avoid the red dot(s) that chase you.
- The game gets harder as you stay near the center, with more dots spawning.
- If a dot catches the goose, the game ends. Press 'y' to play again or 'n' to quit.
